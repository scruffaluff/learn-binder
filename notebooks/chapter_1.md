# Chapter 1: What Is Statistics?

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that concerns the collection, analysis,
interpretation, and presentation of data.

## Definitions

The sample _mean_ of a dataset $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$ is defined as

$$ \bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i. $$

The sample _variance_ of a dataset $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$ is defined as

$$ s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2. $$
